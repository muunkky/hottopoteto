### Step 4 - Derivatives of {{eldorian_word}} ({{english_word}}) - {{connotation}}

#### Brainstorm Possible Meanings and Uses
Explore the conceptual space surrounding the base word. Consider its various connotations, related actions, qualities, or states of being. Let your creativity flow and generate a list of potential meanings that could be expressed through derivatives.

#### Apply Morphological Alterations
Make any necessary morphological alterations to fit Eldorian grammatical or syntactical rules. Create derivatives such as adjectives, verbs, or other nouns that naturally stem from the original word.

Make sure not to accidentally use real world words.

- **Noun Formation from Verbs:** Use the suffix "-esse" to form nouns from verbs, indicating the action or concept derived from the verb. For example: "theleendresse" (greatness) from "theleend" (great), or "sirithesse" (the art or act of weaving) from "sirith" (to weave).
- **Adjective Formation from Nouns:** Use the suffix "-an" or "-ain" to create adjectives from nouns. For example: "moran" (darkened, having the quality of darkness) from "mor" (dark), or "firain" (fiery, pertaining to or like fire) from "fira" (fire).
- **Adverb Formation from Adjectives:** Attach "-lyr" or "-lar" to adjectives to create adverbs. For example: "velenlyr" (quickly) from "velen" (quick).
- **Pluralization of Nouns:** Use "-ai" for regular pluralization. For example: "elenorai" (stars) from "elenor" (star).
- **Gerund Formation from Verbs:** No change required. Just use the indicative version of the verb.
- **Possessive Forms:** No changes required. Use "endin", "en'va", and the "'na" suffix appropriately.
