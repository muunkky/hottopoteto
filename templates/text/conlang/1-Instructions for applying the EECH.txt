# Instructions for applying the Eldorian Etymological Construction Heuristic (EECH)

We are going to be creating a new word and lexicon entry in the conlang "Eldorian". 

The word we will be creating an entry for will be "{{english_word}}". 
More specifically with the connotation of "{{connotation}}"

As we progress through this process, I'd like you to keep these rules in mind.

Rules:
- Don’t tell me what to do, just execute the steps.
- Always read the entire instructions and follow all directions. Do not skip steps or simplify.
- Only execute the directions in one prompt at a time.
- Await my confirmation before proceeding to the next file.
- Do not use any english words
- Do not use any real words from any natural languages

Confirm that you understand the instructions and which word we are creating an entry for so that I can proceed with Step 1.
