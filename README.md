- **Interactive Stories**: Create interactive narrative experiences with branching pathways
- **Custom AI Assistants**: Design specialized assistants with domain-specific knowledge
- **Data Processing**: Build workflows that collect, process, and analyze diverse data sources

## 📋 Core Concepts

### Recipes

Recipes are YAML files that define a sequence of operations (links) to execute:

```yaml
name: "Hello World Recipe"
description: "A simple example recipe"
version: "1.0"
links:
  - name: "User_Input"
    type: "user_input"
    description: "Get user name"
    inputs:
      name:
        type: "string"
        description: "Your name"
    
  - name: "Greeting"
    type: "llm"
    model: "gpt-4o"
    prompt: "Write a greeting for {{ User_Input.data.name }}."
```

### Domains

Domains represent specialized knowledge areas with their own data models, schemas, and utilities:

```bash
# List available domains
python main.py domains list

# Get information about a domain
python main.py domains info conlang
```

### Plugins

Plugins add new link types and functionality:

```bash
# List available plugins
python main.py plugins list

# Get information about a plugin
python main.py plugins info gemini
```

## 🧠 Core Principles

Hottopoteto follows these key architectural principles:

1. **Domain Isolation**: Links operate within a single domain to ensure clean separation
2. **Cross-Domain Communication**: Only core infrastructure enables cross-domain interaction
3. **Secure Credential Management**: API keys and credentials are never stored in code
4. **Recipe Composition**: Recipes orchestrate functionality across domains
5. **Plugin Extensibility**: The system can be extended without modifying core code
