Create {{num_words}} origin words in {{origin_language}} to represent a translation of the english word {{english_word}} with the connotation: {{connotation}}, ensuring they are unique and not based on real-world languages. For example Avys might be an appropriate selection for something non-avian, but since it means "bird" in latin, it shouldn't be used for anything related to birds. Does that make sense?

The origin words should not be the same as the final word. For example, the origin word of principle in Eldorian should not be “principle” in Old Elven. Perhaps the origins could mean “built on stone” or something. Be creative.
Verify that new origin words do not mimic or resemble related words from any existing natural languages, particularly English, French, or Latin. This involves a careful review of the origin's phonetics and semantics. Common mistakes are to use a part of the word from a natural language.

Once you have these words, design a compound word that pieces together a single word. This word can be pretty long as it will be shortened later.
